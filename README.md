**Program Summary**

This program is a quick demo to show some ways to visualize statistical information using
JavaFX. This program demos creating custom animated pie charts and bar charts styled with CSS and
creating custom SVG Path objects. These things are demoed through a global map that has regions
that light up upon mouse entrance and regional statistical popups which can be triggered by clicking
on one of the regions.
